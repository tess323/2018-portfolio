	  	<div class="about">
	  		<p>
	  			I am a web developer and designer located in Seattle who is passionate about working with teams to creatively solve problems. I am fascinated with where design meets development.  My time in the start-ups has taught me to be scrappy and tenacious. I believe that an intuitive and intentional web presence can simplify a hectic world. <br><br>

				I believe in trying new things and pursuing them until they make sense. I have been working with FuseIQ for the past two years to creatively solve non-profit problems using CMS solutions such as Drupal and WordPress. When I am not exploring new languages, seeking out design trends or participating in women in tech events, I am exploring the Pacific Northwest or a new recipe. I want to continue to build and continue to learn.
